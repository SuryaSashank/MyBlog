For this website, I used PHP and mySQL to add funtionality to the website. The funtionality includes allowing users to create posts, post comments, view other users' profiles and upload pictures. A create account feature was added along with login functionality, that kept users logged in 
using sessions. That enables posts and images to belong to a certain user. The session would time out either when the user logs out or when the browser is closed.

The website is not hosted, I used MAMP to test it out. If you want to test the website or make changes to it, install MAMP and copy the contents of this repository 
into the htdocs folder and run it with localhost.

All the code used other than the bootstrap template is mine. Some of the ideas were taken from websites on the internet and I have cited them above. This project was done 
for my Intro to Server-Side Scripting course at Dalhousie University.
